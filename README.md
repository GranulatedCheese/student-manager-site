# Student Manager Site

Small personal project to tryout and get a feel for Flask and creating/storing persistent data in a database. if you wish to run and test this site for yourself, run a server using index.html (_if you see only the folder structure, go to url: localhost:port/client/index.html_), then run main.py. A database should be created. This project may recieve updates and changes as I learn more things about backend development.
